# Resume Bullet Points – Playwright TypeScript BDD Framework (Latest Repo)

Below are professional, ATS‑friendly resume bullet points generated from the latest enhanced repository which includes DB layer, performance testing, CI/CD, and modern Playwright capabilities.

---

## Core Framework Design

- Designed and implemented a **modern automation framework using Playwright, TypeScript, and Cucumber BDD** supporting UI, API, and database testing.
- Built a **hybrid automation framework** enabling end‑to‑end validation across UI, API, and DB layers in a single test flow.
- Developed a scalable layered architecture consisting of **feature files, step definitions, page objects, utilities, and configuration layers**.

---

## BDD Automation Implementation

- Implemented **Cucumber BDD with TypeScript** to create business-readable test scenarios using Gherkin syntax.
- Developed reusable and modular **step definition libraries** aligned with business workflows.
- Enabled **data-driven testing** using environment-based configurations and externalized test data.

---

## Dependency Injection & Context Management

- Utilized **Playwright fixtures and Cucumber world/context pattern** for dependency injection instead of global variables.
- Implemented reusable **login hooks** to centralize authentication and reduce duplicate code.
- Ensured thread-safe and parallel-safe execution through clean context handling.

---

## API Automation Expertise

- Automated API testing using **Playwright APIRequestContext** without external libraries.
- Implemented API validations including:
  - Status code verification  
  - Response time measurement  
  - Data correctness assertions  
- Built hybrid tests combining **API creation followed by UI and DB validation**.

---

## UI Automation Design

- Implemented **Page Object Model (POM)** for UI automation using Playwright.
- Created reusable page classes and utilities for stable and maintainable automation.
- Leveraged Playwright features like **auto-waiting and web‑first assertions** to reduce flakiness.

---

## Database Testing Layer

- Introduced a **generic database utility layer** to enable DB validations in automation.
- Implemented scenarios validating data consistency between API, UI, and database.
- Designed framework to support real database integration with minimal changes.

---

## Performance Testing

- Added **performance testing scripts using Playwright** to measure API response times.
- Integrated basic benchmarking capabilities to validate performance SLAs.
- Enabled lightweight performance validation within functional automation.

---

## Environment & Configuration Management

- Implemented **environment-based configuration management** supporting dev/qa/prod.
- Externalized URLs, credentials, and DB settings for flexible execution.
- Added command-based execution for different environments.

---

## Cross Browser & Mobile Automation

- Configured a full **parallel execution matrix** including:
  - Desktop Chrome  
  - Desktop Firefox  
  - Mobile Chrome  
  - Mobile Safari  
- Enabled responsive and mobile viewport testing using Playwright capabilities.

---

## CI/CD & DevOps Integration

- Integrated automation suite with **GitHub Actions** for continuous testing.
- Added **Docker support** for containerized test execution.
- Enabled pipeline execution with artifact upload of HTML reports.

---

## Reporting & Debugging

- Integrated **Allure reporting** for rich execution analytics.
- Enabled Playwright **trace, screenshots, and video on failure** for debugging.
- Configured automated report generation in CI pipelines.

---

## OOPs & Design Patterns

- Applied strong OOPs principles including:
  - Encapsulation  
  - Abstraction  
  - Inheritance  
  - Polymorphism  
- Used design patterns such as:
  - Page Object Model  
  - Factory/Fixture Pattern  
  - Builder-style API usage  
  - Dependency Injection  

---

## Key Achievements

- Reduced test flakiness using Playwright auto‑waiting and web‑first assertions.
- Enabled true end‑to‑end automation covering **API + UI + DB** in single workflows.
- Improved execution time using parallel and cross-browser matrix execution.
- Delivered an enterprise-ready automation framework with full CI/CD integration.

---

### Summary Statement for Resume

- Developed a comprehensive automation framework using **Playwright, TypeScript, and Cucumber BDD** with API, UI, DB validations, performance testing, Allure reporting, Docker, and GitHub Actions integration, delivering scalable and maintainable end‑to‑end test automation.
