# Interview Ready Explanation Script

I worked on a hybrid automation framework using Playwright, TypeScript and Cucumber BDD. The framework supports UI, API and database automation. We implemented Page Object Model for UI, API utilities for backend testing and a generic DB layer for validations. The suite runs in parallel across desktop and mobile browsers. CI/CD is integrated through GitHub Actions and Docker. Allure reporting and Playwright tracing are used for debugging and analytics.
